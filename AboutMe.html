            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Hi! I'm Ada, Countess of Lovelace and am an English mathematician
              and writer, chiefly known for my work on Charles Babbage's
              proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical
              Engine.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am one of the first to recognize that machines have applications
              beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm
              intended to be carried out by such a machine.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my free time I like to read about scientific developments,
              mathematics, and computational mathematics. I also like to take my
              chances of winning big.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fun fact! I've been programing for
              <span id="time-container">6,597,560,071</span> seconds!
            </p>
